# Introduction
This project is a modified fork of TrinityCore's master repository. I have implemented a few scripts such as a quest skipper for worgens, goblins, pandaren, drac'thyr, and other races with phased starting areas. I have plans to make every class playable on any race the player chooses and have been tinkering with a possible VIP system that gives out some rewards to my supporters.

# Install
You can find a complete installation guide as well as links to the required software on TrinityCore's website: https://trinitycore.info/

When it asks you to clone the repository make sure to use my URL otherwise you won't be able to get the custom scripts.

Please use the SQL files I have provided in the "releases" section of this repo. Some scripts won't load without the modifications I have made to the databases.

The worldserver.conf.dist and bnetserver.conf.dist have been modified as well. Try not to touch them very much.


# Reporting Issues
If you do need assistance please feel free contact me through my community Discord server. You can find the link in the about section of this repository, or on my profile page. I'll do my best to assist.


# Updates
I try to push updates every Tuesday to stay up-to-date with TrinityCore. I will, however, completely forget about it and won't push any changes for weeks. I have a tendency to do that often. But hey, we're all human though, right?
